To run my code, you will need Tensorflow and Keras. To start my agent, go into the python folder, and run the dqnTetrisJoint.py script. This will start the player and it will wait for the simulator. After this, run PlayerSkeleton.java in the src folder. This will launch the simulator and the agent will start playing the game. My file "client.java" needs to be in the same directory as PlayerSkeleton, as it handles the UDP communication between the agent and the simulaion.
